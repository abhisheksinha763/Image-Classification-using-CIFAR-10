# Image-Classification-using-CIFAR-10
Cifar 10 dataset is a bataset imported from keras datasets which contain 60000 different images of airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
In my notebook I have visualised the images has done hot encoding for the output values as there are total of 10 different classes.
Further in this notebook three different cnn models having different layers and units in them are trained and score are analysed for all the models
